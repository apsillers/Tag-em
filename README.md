Taggem is an experimental multiplayer real-time roguelike you can play in your Web browser.

**Play an implementation at https://taggem-apsillers.rhcould.com**

The modular architecture of the code allows you to quickly add new items and monsters to the game. Have a look in `/monsters` and `/objects` to see how they are currently implemented.
